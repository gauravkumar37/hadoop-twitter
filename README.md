Hadoop Twitter Analytics
==============

Hadoop &amp; BigData magic applied on tweets
--------------------------------------------

Hadoop Twitter Analytics aims to develop a solution for analysing tweets using Haddop & its ecosystem.
This project currently contains fetching the Twitter IDs of those users whose statuses have been retweeted the most by the user whose tweets are being analyzed.
Multiple analytics will continue to be added as I work on developing this project. You are very welcome to join me in this endeavour.
